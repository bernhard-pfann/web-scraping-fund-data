Web Scraping Fund Data &amp; Portfolio Analysis

This application allows the user to define a portfolio of funds by ISIN and presents portfolio stratification in a common user-defined currency.

The script is scraping publicly accessbile fund data from www.fondsprofessionell.at. All information is being converted into the desired reporting currency by its current FX spot-rate (sourced from ECB). Among others, the following data points can be automatically retrieved:
- NAV
- Historical performance
- Top holdings
- Asset allocation
- Sector allocation
- Countries
- Currencies

The user-defined list of funds is jointly analyzed to give a holistic view on the portfolio characteristics. The output is presented in various visualizations at the bottom of the document.
